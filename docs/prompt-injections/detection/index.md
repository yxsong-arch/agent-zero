## Upcoming Detection Strategy Guides

The following detection strategy guides are under development and will be added soon:

- Input Detection Strategies
- Output Detection Strategies
- Integrated Defense Approach

## Detection Philosophy

Effective defense against prompt injection requires a multi-layered approach that addresses vulnerabilities at different stages:

1. **Input Screening**: Analyzing user inputs before they reach the AI model
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: Detecting potential exploits during processing
3. **Output Filtering**: Examining responses for signs of successful attacks
4. **Integrated Approaches**: Combining multiple techniques for robust defense

Each strategy offers different advantages in terms of effectiveness, computational cost, and maintenance requirements. A comprehensive defense system typically employs multiple strategies in combination.
