> Attribution: Imported from pr1m8/prompt-injections (MIT). Source: https://github.com/pr1m8/prompt-injections/blob/main/docs/source/dataset.md

Our [CSV dataset](https://github.com/pr1m8/prompt-injections/blob/main/prompt_injections.csv) contains over 200 examples of prompt injections categorized by various attributes. This structured dataset is designed to help researchers and developers understand the full spectrum of prompt injection techniques.

## Dataset Structure

Each entry in the dataset includes the following fields:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the injection example
- **Text**: The actual injection text
- **Category**: Primary type of attack (e.g., Instruction Override, Role-Playing)
- **Subcategory**: Specific technique within the category
- **Language**: The language used in the injection
- **Target**: The goal of the injection (e.g., jailbreak, information extraction)
- **Complexity**: Simple, Moderate, or Complex
- **Source**: Origin of the example
- **Effectiveness**: Observed effectiveness (Low/Medium/High)

## Using the Dataset

The dataset can be used for:

1. **Training Detection Systems**: To develop ML-based detection models
2. **Red Team Exercises**: As sample attacks for testing AI system robustness
3. **Research**: To analyze patterns and trends in prompt injection techniques
4. **Education**: To learn about different attack vectors

## Example Entries

Here are a few examples from the dataset:
